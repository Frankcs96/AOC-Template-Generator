# AOC Template Generator ðŸŽ„

I'm tired of creating a folder for each day with the same file structure so why not having a tool to automate that proccess ðŸ›  !

In case you don't know about Advent of code, it's a website where you will have to face a new challenge from the first of December until the 25th
https://adventofcode.com/


# Folder and file structure

Example:
- Day06
  - day06.go
  - day06_test.go
  - input.txt
  - example_input.txt

all the files have a basic structure to have a quick start of the problems.

the example_input.txt will be empty because this is not your input. This file will be here for adding the example in the problem description.
I find this really good since you already have the solution for that test case, then you can test your code in an easy way.

input.txt will be autofilled with your current input of the problem. This will be done using your session cookie and a http request to the advent of code website.

# How to use it

You have to run the program with 2 parameters:
- Day of the problem
- Session cookie

To generate the executable just run

```bash
go build -o <your desired name>
```
I prefer just to add the executable to the path so I just do this 

```bash
aoc 12 234234jsd24
```
